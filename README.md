## ‚ú® Features

This bot is packed with features to reduce manual work for your staff and improve the experience for your members.

  * üìù **Application System:** A fully automated application process. Admins create a panel with a button, and users apply via a private DM conversation. Completed applications are posted in a staff-only channel.
  * üéüÔ∏è **Ticket System:** A professional support ticket system. Users click a button to create a private ticket channel with support staff, who can close the ticket with another button.
  * ‚öôÔ∏è **Server Status Panel:** An admin-only control panel with buttons to instantly post beautiful, branded announcements about server status (Online, Restart, Maintenance) to a public channel.
  * ‚è≥ **Persistent Temporary Roles:** Grant users a role for a specific duration (e.g., "7d" for VIP). The bot automatically removes the role when the time expires and **remembers all scheduled tasks even if it restarts**, thanks to its SQLite database.
  * üé§ **Voice Channel Notifier:** Automatically announces in a text channel when a user joins a designated voice channel, helping to encourage community interaction.
  * üé® **Fully Customizable Branding:** Almost every message the bot sends is an embed that can be customized with your server's name, logo, colors, and images via a simple configuration file.

        ```bash
        node deploy-commands.js
        ```

6.  **Invite the Bot**

      * On the Developer Portal, go to "OAuth2" -\> "URL Generator".
      * Select the scopes: `bot` and `applications.commands`.
      * In the "Bot Permissions" section below, grant it `Administrator` permissions for simplicity, or select the individual permissions it needs (`Manage Roles`, `Manage Channels`, `Send Messages`, `Read Message History`, etc.).
      * Copy the generated URL and paste it into your browser to invite the bot to your server.

7.  **Start the Bot**
    You're all set\! Start the bot by running:

## ‚öôÔ∏è Usage (Admin Commands)

Once the bot is running, use these slash commands in your Discord server to set up its features.

  * `/setup-application`

      * Run this in the channel where you want users to start applying (e.g., `#applications`). The bot will post the panel with the "Start Application" button.

  * `/setup-ticket-panel`

      * Run this in the channel where you want users to request help (e.g., `#support`). The bot will post the panel with the "Create Ticket" button.

  * `/server-panel`

      * **IMPORTANT:** Run this in a **private staff-only channel**. The bot will post the control panel with buttons for managing public server status announcements.

  * `/add-role`

      * Use this command to grant a temporary role to a user.
      * **Usage:** `/add-role user:@User role:@Role duration:7d reason:VIP Trial`

### A Note on Persistence

This bot uses **SQLite** to store data about temporary roles. This information is saved to a file named `data.sqlite` in your project folder.

This database ensures that if your bot restarts for any reason (e.g., a power outage, server maintenance, or a crash), it will automatically check for any pending role removals and reschedule them correctly. This makes the temporary role feature highly reliable.
